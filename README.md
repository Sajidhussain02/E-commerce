# E-commerce
This project focuses on cleaning and analyzing raw e-commerce customer data to extract meaningful insights.The dataset is cleaned by handling missing values, correcting data types, and creating useful derived columns.  I did it by using using libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
